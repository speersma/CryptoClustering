# CryptoClustering

## Crypto_Clustering.ipynb

The `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` contains two Kmean cluster analyses of cryptocurrencies.  

The first analyses operates on the original data, which had seven features. An elbow plot was utilized to decide on the number of clusters. 

The second cluster analyses clustered data that had undergone principle components analysis. The PCA reduced the features to three principle components. Approximately 88% of the variance of the original seven features was captured by these three principle components. 

Both the analyses revealed clusters that seemed only somewhat clear. Two outliers, ethland and celsius-degree-token, were assigned into their own groups.
